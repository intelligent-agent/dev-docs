Current theme is specifying screen size & positions in pixels from screen origin (where (0,0) is bottom left).

Modify the theme syntax to have themes use relative positionining for a screen ratio (assume a 16:9 ratio).
Modify the Toggle configuration to add a screen resolution field.
Modify the Toggle theme parser to match, so that the theme is properly loaded with changing resolutions (720p and 1080p) coming from the Toggle configuration.
