3D printing and CNC machining share additional controls for machining that lets the user adjust the speed of the machine in real time.

Toggle is missing the controls to allow the user to increase or decrease the machining speed.

Add controls to increase and reduce the feed and the flow.

The feed is going to modify the global printer speed 
  - set it to 90% and all subsequent given movements will be executed at 90% of their programmed speed.

The flow is the amount of the extrusion only 
- set it to 90% and the extruded plastic volume will be reduced from the move command's programmed speed.
