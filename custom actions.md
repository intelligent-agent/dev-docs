Users fit the electronics and touch-screens to a wide-ranging variety of machines.

And each user has different preferences for repeated maintenance tasks (loading & unloading filament, calibration, etc.).
A maintenance task consists of a G-code macro - a string with multiple line breaks.
1. Allow the user to define a macro in the configuration file, which should be a variable length paragraph, with a macro name
2. Add a new view panel where to put an activation button per macro with a configuration based layout.
3. Allow a user-specified icon to be provided to act as the activation button
4. Make the layout of macros on the panel automatic based on the number of macros defined, create an additional panel if needed
